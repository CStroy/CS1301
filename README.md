# CS1301
Group project for CS1301 @ GSU

Class Group Project (100 Points)
You are going to create a switch loop with different options.
Option 1: Ask users to input Person Name, Ticket Type and Fine. You will keep asking users until they press q key. Once user types Q, you will store all the details into the .txt file or any other file
Option 2: Use the file that is generated from Option 1 and perform sorting by person name. You also need to prompt users if option 1 is not complete. You will then create another file with sorted person name.
Option 3: Display file
You will read entire file from option 1 and display it on the screen. I would like to see everything as comma separated. You also need to use exception handling here.
Option 4:
Ask users to enter a search keyword. You will then search the keyword in the file (option 1) and display success or failure message
Option 5: Use the array concept and read the person name from the file. Just view the entire array on the output screen.
Option 6: Replace function. Ask users to replace ticket type and generate a new file with new ticket type. Please keep rest of the information same as it is. 
Option 7: Delete all the files from hard drive
